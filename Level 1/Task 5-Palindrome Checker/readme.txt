# Palindrome Check

This Python program checks if a given string is a palindrome.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the string you want to check.
3. The program will output whether the string is a palindrome.

## Code Explanation

- The program defines a function `palindrome_check` that takes a string as input, reverses it, and checks if the reversed string is equal to the original string.
- It prints whether the string is a palindrome directly to the console.

## Example

Enter the string: racecar
The string 'racecar' is a palindrome.
