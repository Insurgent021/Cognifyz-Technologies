# Email Validator

This Python program checks if a given email address is valid based on basic criteria.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the email address you want to validate.
3. The program will output whether the email address is valid.

## Code Explanation

- The program defines a function `is_valid_email` that takes an email address as input and checks if it meets basic validation criteria (contains exactly one '@' symbol, a non-empty username and domain, and a valid top-level domain).
- It prints whether the email address is valid directly to the console.

## Example

Enter email: test@mail.com
True
